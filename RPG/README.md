For this project I used processing which is a jave based programming environment. Processing allows the programming to create graphical programs with more ease.
This project was my first attempt at creating a game with a birdseye view of the player and a world that the player could explore. This project heavily relies
on OOP. The goal is to explore the world and defeat enemies to level up. Enemies are randomly scattered throughout the world alongside random health potions and
rocks that serve as obstacles.

This project also helped me develop my skills working with very large scale projects. The game is made up of 10+ classes which all work together to create the game.
I also created many versions of this project and spent lots of time fixing previous bugs and tweaking values in the game before I felt like the project was at a
good point to move forward.

Hopefully you enjoy and I will probably one day create a new version of this game with the new knowledge I have aquired.
